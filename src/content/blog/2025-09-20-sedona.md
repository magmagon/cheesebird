# Welcome to my first ever blog post!

I'm not quite sure what I'm doing at the moment, but bear with me as I attempt to create this site as a way to showcase cool places. Sedona is a small resort town in the north central area of Arizona known for its colorful rocks, spirituality and celebrity sitings. One of the most iconic sights is that of Capitol Butte and Sedona viewed from the north side of Airport Mesa.
